# Student Attendance Contract - Foundry
The Attendance smart contract is a simple on-chain student record and attendance tracking system built with Solidity. It allows anyone to register students and update their attendance status while keeping a transparent, verifiable record on the blockchain.

The contract allows:
- Student Registration – Add a new student with a name and age. Each student is stored on-chain with a unique ID.
- Attendance Tracking – Update and record whether a student is present or absent.
- Data Retrieval – Fetch full student details (name, age, attendance status) using the student ID.
- Student Count – Get the total number of registered students.
- Event Logging – Emits blockchain events whenever:
- A new student is added (StudentAdded)
